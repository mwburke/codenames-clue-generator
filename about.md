My name is Matthew Burke, and I'm using this website to share some of the things I'm interested in.

I work as a data scientist, and the rest of the time I like to play video games, hike, read sci-fi, cook, watch stupid comedies, listen to [funky music](https://vulfpeck.com/), hang out with friends and family, create silly art stuff, and spend far too much time shopping online without buying anything.

Here's a quote that motivates me:

> Dude, suckin' at something is the first step towards being sorta good at something. - Jake the Dog
