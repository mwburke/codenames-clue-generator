                        <h2>About the Author</h2>
                        <p>
                            My name is Matthew Burke, and I'm a data scientist with a passion for the intersection of machine learning, optimization and data visualization.

                        <h3>Education</h3>
                        <p>Masters in Information and Data Science, UC Berkeley</p>

                        <p>
                            Visualization can be a powerful tool to summarize information in an easily digestible format, and so I have been forced to delve in to the world of web development in order to communicate these ideas. Fortunately, there are a lot of great resources to reduce the complexities of getting up and running, like Jekyll which is used to power this blog. 
                        </p>
